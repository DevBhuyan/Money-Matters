# Compound Calculator Dashboard

A **Streamlit** based dashboard that aggregates a collection of financial calculators for compound interest, EMI, loan pre‑payment, SIP, and more.  Users can select a calculator from the sidebar, adjust parameters using sliders or precise number inputs, and instantly see the results.

---

## Features

- **Multiple calculators** bundled under a single UI (see the `finance/` package).
- **Dual input controls** – a slider for quick selection and a number input for fine‑tuned values, kept in sync via Streamlit `session_state`.
- Automatic handling of type‑matching for Streamlit widgets (int/float consistency).
- Clean, responsive layout using Streamlit’s wide mode and column layout.

## Adding a New Calculator

1. Create a new module in the `finance/` directory implementing a `calculate(**kwargs)` function.
2. Add an entry to `calculators.py` with the required input configuration (label, widget type, defaults, etc.).
3. The dashboard will automatically pick it up via the sidebar.
